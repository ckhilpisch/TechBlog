## Description:
Tasked with creating a Tech Blog website that users can interface with that makes it easy for the user to view and interact with information stored in a blog website. I was challenged with architecting  and building a website where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well.  I was to use the MVC paradigm in the architectural structure, while utilizing handlebars as the HTML templating language, with Sequelize as the ORM and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation :
The application can be run via the heroku app link provided.  
It can also be accessed locally, by running it in your terminal.   
In order to run locally, use the following command to run the installation packages:
```bash
npm i
```
Then use this to seed the information:
```bash
node seeds/seed.js
```
The application is invoked by using the following command:
```bash
node server.js
```

The application is also connected with a mySQL workbench, where there are three interrelated tables that are stored with users, blogs, and comments as the tables.  The database is called techblog_db.  Using the seed data will populate some previously created users and blogs.    

## Usage: 
The user will open the command terminal inside the chosen coding platform.  The user will then run node server.js inside the command line.   The terminal then connects to the localhost:3001 url.   Otherwise use the heroku.app link for this application at:


The user can:
<ul> 
<li>View Homepage/Blogs</li>
<li>Login or Signup</li>
<li>View all of their blogs(dashboard)</li>
<li>Delete their own blogs</li>
<li>View other Blogs</li>
